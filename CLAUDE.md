# My neovim confighis
This project is my neovim config

## Rules for changes
* When a new keybinding is added/created it should be added to the auto-documentation.
* When I work on any project I normally navigate with either nvim-tree or Telescope, so for any new config regarthing buffers or similar need to consider both plugins.
